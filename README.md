# Ryan Figueredo

Full Stack Developer · Curitiba, Brazil  
Founder at DMTN Sistemas. I build B2B SaaS end to end with Next.js, Node, Prisma, and PostgreSQL (deploy on Vercel/AWS). My focus is fintech, operations, and Pix automation.

## What I am building
- **KL Drive** — vehicle and fuel management with dashboards and a performance profile.
- **KL Facilities (Checklist)** — operational checklists and reports; web now, mobile next.
- **Receivables Platform** — issue invoices, control payments, borderô PDF, and early payment; NextAuth + Postgres.
- **Document Management** — AWS S3 uploads, batches, and roles (admin/consultant/master).
- **Accounting Marketplace (MVP)** — pro validation, service routing, and payment hold until delivery.
- **Payment integrations** — Pix with Mercado Pago (transparent checkout), unique keys, and webhooks.

## Tech stack
- **Front end:** Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui  
- **Back end:** Node.js, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL (Supabase/Neon)  
- **Auth:** NextAuth (Credentials/JWT)  
- **Infra:** Vercel, AWS S3, Nginx  
- **Data/BI:** Google Sheets, Looker Studio  
- **Payments:** Mercado Pago (Pix)

## Recent highlights
- Borderô **PDF generation** with financial math and configurable fees.  
- Admin panels with **role-based access** and audit.  
- **Digital key delivery** after payment, with reuse blocked.  
- Daily **finance dashboards** for clear decisions.

## How I can help
I design and ship B2B SaaS, Pix payment flows, operational dashboards, process automation, and upgrades to a modern stack.
